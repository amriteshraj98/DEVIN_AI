# DevCollab - AI Powered Chat APP
Developed full-stack chat application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN), enabling user authentication (signup/login) and project creation.

- Implemented collaborative chat functionality, allowing registered users to add collaborators and seamlessly communicate within project-specific chatrooms.

- Integrated Gemini API (Google's LLM) into the chat interface to provide AI‑driven insights, auto‑responses, or suggestions directly within project conversations.

- Designed RESTful API endpoints for user management, project operations, collaborator invitations, and message handling, ensuring secure and scalable backend interactions.

- Built React-based front‑end UI featuring real-time chat updates (via Socket.io or similar) and dynamic forms for project/collaborator setup and AI‑assisted chat responses.

- Managed state and async operations using Redux or Context API, handling user sessions, chat streams, and AI response workflows smoothly.

- Deployed the application on [platform you used, e.g., Vercel/Heroku/AWS], including CI/CD pipelines and environment configuration for MongoDB, Node.js, and Gemini API keys.

- Ensured modular, maintainable code practices via component-based React structure, model‑controller‑route architecture in Express, and environment-based configuration.

- Tested application functionality through unit/integration tests for backend APIs, and end‑to‑end flow validation for user registration, chat flows, and AI integration.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
